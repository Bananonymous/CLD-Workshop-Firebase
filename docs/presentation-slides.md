## Slide 7: Cost Analysis - Realistic Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Small Team (50 users)
| Service | Monthly Usage | Cost |
|---------|---------------|------|
| Database | 300K reads, 60K writes | $3.60 |
| Storage | 1GB | $0.03 |
| Hosting | 5GB bandwidth | Free |
| **Total** | | **$3.63** |

### Scenario 2: Growing Business (500 users)
| Service | Monthly Usage | Cost |
|---------|---------------|------|
| Database | 3M reads, 300K writes | $27 |
| Storage | 50GB | $1.25 |
| Hosting | 100GB bandwidth | $8.50 |
| Functions | 10K invocations | $2.40 |
| **Total** | | **$39.15** |

### Traditional Infrastructure Comparison
- Small setup: $200-500/month → Firebase: $4/month
- Medium setup: $800-1500/month → Firebase: $40/month
- **Savings: 85-95%**

## Slide 8: Cost Scaling Analysis
### When Firebase Becomes Expensive
- Very high-volume applications (>10M operations/month)
- Heavy computational workloads
- Large file storage requirements (>1TB)

### Break-even Point
- Approximately 5,000-10,000 active users
- Consider hybrid approaches at scale
- Factor in development and maintenance savings

## Slide 9: Vendor Lock-in Analysis
### Risk Assessment
**High Risk Areas:**
- Firestore query syntax
- Real-time database features
- Cloud Functions architecture

**Medium Risk:**
- Authentication (OAuth standards)
- File storage (standard APIs)

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Data export capabilities**
2. **API abstraction layers**
3. **Regular backup strategies**
4. **Multi-cloud planning**

### Exit Strategy
- Estimated migration time: 2-6 months
- Cost: $30K-80K for medium applications
- Factor into ROI calculations

## Slide 10: Live Demonstration
### Demo Application: Task Manager
**Features to Showcase:**
1. User registration/authentication
2. Real-time task creation and updates
3. Multi-device synchronization
4. Offline capabilities
5. Instant collaboration

**Business Relevance:**
- Team collaboration tool
- Project management
- Real-time updates
- Mobile accessibility

## Slide 11: Technical Demo Script
1. **Authentication** (30 seconds)
   - Create account instantly
   - Secure login process

2. **Real-time Collaboration** (90 seconds)
